This was a great stand-alone Star Wars movie - Robel Semunegus 

Totally agree - always been a fan of 'origin style' stories.

Unpopular opinion, but rogue one is my favorite of all the star wars. - Carly

Best Star Wars movie by far.

My favorite too, after the original trilogy.

Very intense and thrilling.
