All of my friends hated Solo. I watched the movie twice. The first time I watched it, I didn't really enjoy the majority of the movie. 
The ending was different from other Star Wars movie endings, and I found that interesting.
It made me like the movie more, and I saw it a second time. 

Did all of your friends hate Solo?
- I feel like Solo gets a bad rap. It isn't the best movie of all time, but it is definitely better than ep. I (except for the Darth Maul battle). - DJL
I thought the movie Solo was not good, dare I say it was SO-LOW on my list of star wars media.
